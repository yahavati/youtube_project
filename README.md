A Youtube Application created in Android Studio. In order to run the application you need an Android device with an API level which is at least 24. You should have a working camera, and if you don't- it's fine, just make sure you have a photo in your gallery (in order to sign up, it's mandatory to upload a picture). In addition, if you want to upload videos you should have videos in your gallery. You run the application and reach the home screen where you can watch videos, like and comment. In order to like or comment you should log in. In the bottom menu, on the right corner, there is a "you" button. Pressing on it will bring you to a page where pressing on user's icon will bring you to login, and when logged in, to log out. In the same page you can see the button "your vidoes"- you can go there only if you are logged in and upload videos which will appear in home screen. You can also edit there the vidoes and delete them - but only the videos that the current user uploaded. You can Search videos by the author's name, the title and description, if exists. You can like, comment (by clicking on view comments while watching a video) and watch as many videos that you want. You can pause videos and continue playing them by pressing on the video itself while watching it. Enjoy the app!
